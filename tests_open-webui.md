### We are using open source https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui local for our first MVP. 

It has several functions with its browser interface, like model change, TTS, STT for our purpose. Together with n8n, we can also connect to several chat apps...
Knowledge is filled with several sources, like texts from c-booc or pressemappe etc. 

Several Models are tested to be qualified for our specific use (good balance between knowledge/RAG and character simulation):
- Qwen2.5vl:latest
- Dolphin3:8b

also OK, but sometimes too slow
- Openchat:latest
- Quen3:8b
- mistral:latest

It works in german and english.
