# c-base LLM Project

Welcome to the c-base LLM (Large Language Model) project! This initiative aims to integrate a locally-hosted, open-source AI system into the c-base environment, enhancing its functionality as a partially reactivated spaceship computer (c-beam). Below are the key requirements and objectives of the project.

## Key Objectives
- Implement a **self-hosted LLM** tailored to the c-base history.
- Enable **multi-user** and **multi-instance** interactions for different rooms (e.g., Workshop vs. Nerd Area).
- Develop a **sandbox environment** for experimentation and development.

## Technical Requirements

### AI Model
- **Feasibility**: An LLM that can be fine-tuned with minimal effort to integrate c-base history.
- **Efficiency**: Smaller models preferred, optimized for local hardware.
- **Compatibility**: Support for LLM-compatible agent systems and modular design.

### Voice Integration
- **Voice-to-Text**: Evaluate and integrate suitable models, such as Whisper, for converting voice commands to text.
- **Input Methods**: Support for sending voice messages via platforms like Matrix.
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Integrate push-to-talk microphones for user privacy somewhere at c-base location.

### Multi-User and Multi-Instance Support
- Ensure simultaneous responses for different rooms.
- Focus on sufficient **VRAM capacity** for handling multiple interactions.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Budget Options**: Feasible with used hardware (~â‚¬1000) using LLaMa or LoRA models.
- **High-End Options**: Explore NVIDIA Project Digits (~$3000) for cutting-edge performance.
- **Future-Proofing**: Consider waiting for the second generation of such hardware for better pricing and stability.

### Audio and Communication System
- Revamp the c-base **ELA system** for room-specific announcements.
- Equip c-beam with spatial audio features.

## Community Involvement
- Engage key members (e.g., "lazee" and "sasquatsch") with expertise in self-hosted AI technologies.
- Secure volunteers with coding skills for long-term support and development.

## Financial Considerations
- Medium- to high-budget projects are possible, funded through c-base reserves.
- Ensure the majority of the c-base crew supports the project.

## Next Steps
1. Collect and refine additional requirements.
2. Evaluate potential models and hardware solutions.
3. Develop a prototype in a sandbox environment.
4. Gradually roll out the solution across c-base.
