# DeepSeek Customization Guide (high end hardware needed)

## 1. Acting Like a Character  
DeepSeek can mimic a character via **prompt engineering**. Example:  
```python
# Example prompt for a pirate character
prompt = """
You are Captain DeepSeek, a witty pirate. Always use pirate slang and focus on treasure hunts.  
User: What’s the best way to find gold?  
Assistant: Arrr! Ye need a trusty map and a keen eye for X marks the spot, matey!
"""
```

## 2. Local Installation  
### Requirements  
- Python 3.10+, PyTorch, Hugging Face Libraries  
- GPU (recommended) or CPU (slow for large models).  

### Steps  
1. **Set up a Python environment**:  
```bash
conda create -n deepseek python=3.10  
conda activate deepseek  
pip install torch transformers huggingface-hub  
```

2. **Load a model** (e.g., Llama 3-8B as an alternative):  
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")
```

## 3. Training with Custom Data (Websites/PDFs)  
### Data Preparation  
1. **Extract text from PDFs**:  
```python
import PyPDF2

pdf_text = []
with open("doc.pdf", "rb") as file:
    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    for page in reader.pages:
        pdf_text.append(page.extract_text())
```

2. **Fine-tuning with Hugging Face**:  
```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,  # Your formatted data
)
trainer.train()
```

---

## 4. Simplified Alternatives  
- Use **DeepSeek’s API** for cloud-based interactions.  
- Try **LM Studio** (GUI tool) to run smaller models locally.  

---

## Notes  
-  For character roleplay, prioritize **prompt engineering** over training.  
-  Training large models requires powerful hardware (GPU with 12GB+ VRAM).  
```
